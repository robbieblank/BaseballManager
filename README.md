# Baseball Manager App
A little fun application I made on the side. Can be used to manage a baseball team with roster, stats, and games. Written in java.

# Running the app
Just download the project and run the JAR. Sometimes the JAR doesn't work, and if it doesn't, the project can be pulled into an IDE like IntelliJ and the MainWindow class can be run.
